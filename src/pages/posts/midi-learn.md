## 🎹 What I'm Building

Tool to help me get better at sight reading western musical notation

## 🧠 Goals & Learning Objectives

* Improve my sight-reading skills
* Visualize notes in real-time
* Get more comfortable with audio/web APIs

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

* HTML/CSS/JavaScript
* [Web MIDI API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_MIDI_API)
* Python?
* Canvas or SVG for note rendering (TBD)
* Possibly Vite or Astro for setup?

## ✅ Progress So Far

-

## 📝 Notes to Self

- do it.

## 🧪 Experiment Log

## 📚 Resources

* [MDN Web MIDI API Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_MIDI_API)
* [VexFlow – JavaScript music notation rendering](https://www.vexflow.com/)
* [Tone.js – Web audio framework](https://tonejs.github.io/)
* [HTML MIDI access example (codepen)](https://codepen.io/stuartmemo/pen/EKweQo)

## 🚧 First Steps

* I don't know what to build this with. Need to talk to some ppl \[chatgpt] and figure out tech stack. 
* Basic idea steps- 

## 🤔 Challenges & Questions

  show new note on screen--> wait for and receive midi input --> if correct, show green -->repeat 
* Build more:

  * speed feature for rate at which you show notes
  * maybe look up spaced repetition and what are the ideal intervals to show same note?
  * should notes be bundled into packets to learn and then eventually all notes?
  * left and right hand independence?
  * option for show a note on the screen and then sing it and check?

*Stay tuned for updates as I iterate on this!*
