## 🧠 Idea Bank: Things I Want to Build

This is a living list of projects I want to build — to learn, practice, and eventually show off what I can do. Some will be tiny; others could grow into portfolio pieces.

### General Projects (ie- I don't yet know what to build it with)

- [ ] Tool to teach me to read musical notation better (with MIDI capability)

### 🔨 JavaScript Projects

- [ ]

### ⚛️ React Projects

- [ ]

### 💨 Tailwind / UI Challenges

- [ ]

### 🚀 Astro Site Features

- [ ]

### 🌐 APIs & Backend (later)

- [ ]

This list will grow and evolve as I keep learning. I’ll link finished projects to their live demos or repo when done.
